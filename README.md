# Stopwatch-NogaMatt

## What?
Create a stopwatch that shows hours, minutes, seconds, 100ths of seconds.

## Why?
We would like to experiment with different ways of representing passing time.

## How?
Using TDD ping pong we will methodiclly develop a functioning stopwatch. We can also use the test to check refactoring.

## Stretch Goals
Visual representation as sand timer/particle effect.
Countdown Timer
Look into p5.js - visual processing library.
Emit particle for hundredths, seconds, minutesD
Different colours for different particle emission frequencies
Particle counter
